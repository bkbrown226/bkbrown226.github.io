Hello! This is where you can find some of the coding projects I have worked on.

* The folder titled Analyzing Divvy Ride Data houses a project I created in 2022 analyzing ride data for the bicycle rental company Divvy in the city of Chicago for the month of May 2022, which can be found [here.](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) The goal of this project was to use the data to discern who in Chicago uses Divvy bikes and for what purpose, based on the start and end times/locations of rides for this month as well as weather data from the National Weather Service. The project also focuses on the Hyde Park neighborhood, and shows that riders in Hyde Park are more inclined to use Divvy bikes to get around their neighborhood than commute between neighborhoods when compared to the average Chicagoan.
