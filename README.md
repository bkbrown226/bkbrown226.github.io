Hello! This is where you can some of the coding projects I have worked on, as well as information about them.

* [This project](https://github.com/danielgrzenda/gnn_explain) is a collaboration between me and Daniel Grzenda, a University of Chicago computer science PhD student. We are currently working to understand how different convolutional layers in graphical neural networks (GNNs) perform on graphs based on statistics about the graphs such as density diameter, assortativity, and more. For this project, I first wrote a script that computes and saves the statistics for 90 of the PyTorch Geometric library's built-in datasets, using the parallelization library Parsl to analyze multiple datasets in parallel. We are currently working on a framework to build, train, and evaluate multiple simple GNNs in parallel, where each uses one of around 30 different GNN layers, on each dataset.
* I created [this project](https://github.com/bkbrown226/bkbrown226.github.io/blob/main/Flight_Delay_Prediction.ipynb) for the class Data Science for Computer Scientists in autumn 2023. In it I utilized graphical analysis, feature engineering, data cleaning, and model selection to build a classifier that uses flight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to predict whether a given flight will be delayed by 15 or more minutes. The project is written in Python using the numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn libraries.
* In summer 2022, I developed the [static map](https://github.com/Matico-Platform/matico/tree/main/matico_charts/src/components/Plots/StaticMapComponent) and [box-and-whisker/violin plot](https://github.com/Matico-Platform/matico/tree/main/matico_charts/src/components/Plots/DistributionPlotComponent) components for the geospatial data analysis web app [Matico](https://www.matico.app/). Working with another intern, I took base code from the [visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/gallery) library and modified it to work in Matico's framework, as well as added desired features such as customizable colors and additional map projections. The most significant aspect of this project was getting the plots to work and look nice with any data set given to them.

In addition, I have included two projects I made in summer 2022 for a course I enrolled in called Computing for the Social Sciences. Both projects involve analysis of real-world data using graphical visualization as well as text. They are written in R using the tidyverse collection of packages.

* [Exploring Divvy Ride Data](https://github.com/bkbrown226/bkbrown226.github.io/tree/main/Analyzing%20Divvy%20Ride%20Data) is a project I created in 2022 analyzing ride data for the bicycle rental company Divvy in the city of Chicago for the month of May 2022, which can be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The goal of this project was to use the data to analyze who in Chicago uses Divvy bikes and for what purpose, based on the start and end times/locations of rides for this month. I also incorporated weather data from the National Weather Service in my analysis. Part of my project focuses on the Hyde Park neighborhood, and shows that riders in Hyde Park are more inclined to use Divvy bikes to get around their neighborhood than commute between neighborhoods when compared to the average Chicagoan.
* In [this project](https://github.com/bkbrown226/bkbrown226.github.io/tree/main/Web%20data%20analysis) I analyzed 150 years of additional NWS weather and climate data to understand how the temperature in Chicago changes on a monthly and yearly basis. I obtained the data via writing code that scrapes the NWS website. When noticing an increasing trend in yearly average temperatures, I used the data to investigate which parts of the year had increased in temperature the most. I found that spring and summer had tended to get warmer than fall or winter.
