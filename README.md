Hello! This is where you can some of the coding projects I have worked on, as well as information about them.

* [Exploring Divvy Ride Data](https://github.com/bkbrown226/bkbrown226.github.io/tree/main/Analyzing%20Divvy%20Ride%20Data) is a project I created in 2022 analyzing ride data for the bicycle rental company Divvy in the city of Chicago for the month of May 2022, which can be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The goal of this project was to use the data to analyze who in Chicago uses Divvy bikes and for what purpose, based on the start and end times/locations of rides for this month. I also incorporated weather data from the National Weather Service in my analysis. Part of my project focuses on the Hyde Park neighborhood, and shows that riders in Hyde Park are more inclined to use Divvy bikes to get around their neighborhood than commute between neighborhoods when compared to the average Chicagoan.
* In summer 2022, I developed the [static map](https://github.com/Matico-Platform/matico/tree/main/matico_charts/src/components/Plots/StaticMapComponent) and [box-and-whisker/violin plot](https://github.com/Matico-Platform/matico/tree/main/matico_charts/src/components/Plots/DistributionPlotComponent) components for the geospatial data analysis web app [Matico](https://www.matico.app/). Working with another intern, I took base code from the [visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/gallery) library and modified it to work in Matico's framework, as well as added desired features such as customizable colors and additional map projections. The most significant aspect of this project was getting the plots to work and look nice with any data set given to them.
