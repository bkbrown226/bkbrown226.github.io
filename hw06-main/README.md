This file serves to describe the purpose of everything in my HW06 repository.

* **data:** Contains Chicago-weather-data.csv, daily Chicago weather data for May 2022. I obtained this data [from the NWS's website](https://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate?wfo=lot) but had to paste and format it into a .csv file myself. It also contains 202205-divvy-tripdata.csv after the setup chunk in Data-analysis.rmd which creates it is run. This data set cannot be uploaded to GitHub due to large file size, and .gitignore was modified to not track it.
* **Data-analysis_files:** Contains the figure-gfm folder, which contains images of all the graphs seen in Data-analysis.Rmd and Data-analysis.md.
* **Data-analysis.Rmd** is the Rmd file which contains all of the R code used to create the graphs, as well as written analysis.
* **Data-analysis.md** Is the knit .md version of Data-analysis.Rmd, with all the R code hidden.
